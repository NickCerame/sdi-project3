<p>I decided to refactor my code from the week two assignment. I was happy enough with the story line to be able to focus more on the new material that we learned this week. I thought it would prove more useful to spend more time with the material than trying to think up a new story. My plan was to expand on the "game" if I was able to grasp the new material quick enough, but unfortunately that didn't happen. The hardest concept for me to incorporate into my code was the public/private data. However, I think the project turned out alright even with the roadblocks I faced.</p>
